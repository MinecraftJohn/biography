This was a challenging project because making a sentence to introduce something was my weakness just like making this readme file üòÅ. This project challenge me to try inline SVG on a webpage and modern responsive design. The design was inpired by Windows 11 darkmode theme and because of this project I was forced to make my very own logo. I was able to implement a PHP array on this project since the professor required so. It is also based on database so the server side basic function was applied while I was coding.

It was a challenging and fun experience, feel free to suggest for improvement.
