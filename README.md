This project is for my school subject WEB 241<br>
<br>
This is my second web project in school. This project serves as my resume according to my professor, and visiting this site will let you know who I am on a biography based. This project helps me learn how to use array in PHP and use placeholder for dynamic changes instead of hard coded. Thanks to w3school and YouTube community for helping me build this project. The design of this project was based on my own will.<br>
<br>
This project might mark as inactive one day as I have no idea what to add sooner. Feel free to suggest some challenges to this project on Issues.<br>

This project is maintained by <a href="https://github.com/MinecraftJohn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Napoles</a> and is open to contributions!
